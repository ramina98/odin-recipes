<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Of course, you could just order out, but nothing beats a homemade pizza. The sauce is so easy and hearty everyone will think you were in the kitchen all day cooking this up!

</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li>2 teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
<li>1 cup warm water</li>
<li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
<li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
<li>1 tablespoon dried oregano</li>
<li>1 teaspoon sat</li>
<li>1 egg</li>
<li>1 tablespoon dried oregano</li>
<li>1 egg</li>
<li>1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil</li>
<li>1 can diced tomatoes</li>
<li>1 can tomato paste</li>
<li>1/2 small onion, chopped</li>
<li>1 tablespoon dried oregano</li>
<li>1 clove garlic, finely chopped</li>
<li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
<li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
<li>1 pinch ground black pepper</li>
<li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
<li>1/2 cup chopped green bell pepper</li>
<li>1/2 cup sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>

    <li>Sprinkle yeast over warm water in a small bowl. The water should be no more than 100 degrees F (40 degrees C). Let stand for 5 minutes until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam.</li>
    <li>Sift flour, sugar, 1 tablespoon oregano, and 1 teaspoon salt into a large bowl. Mix egg and oil into dry ingredients; stir in yeast mixture. When dough has pulled together, turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes. Lightly oil a large bowl, then place dough in bowl and turn to coat with oil. Cover with a light cloth and let rise in a warm place (80 to 95 degrees F (27 to 35 degrees C)) until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.
        <li>Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (235 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet.</li>
    </li>
    <li>Cook and stir diced tomatoes, tomato paste, onion, 1 tablespoon oregano, garlic, onion powder, 1 teaspoon salt, and pepper in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook until sauce has thickened, 15 to 20 minutes.

    </li>
    <li>Punch down dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Use a knife to divide dough into two equal pieces--do not tear. Shape dough into rounds and let rest for 10 minutes. Form dough into rectangles, and place onto prepared baking sheet. Spoon tomato sauce over dough. Sprinkle with 1 1/4 cup mozzarella cheese; top with bell pepper, onion, and mushroom. Sprinkle 1/4 cup mozzarella cheese over top.

    </li>
    <li>Bake in preheated oven until crust is browned and crisp and cheese has melted, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
